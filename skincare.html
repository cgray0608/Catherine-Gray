                <p class= "w3-justify w3-center w3-large w3-text-black">Skincare could easily be considered one of the most important aspects of someone's hygeine routine, as well as their makeup routine. Someone's skincare routine and the condition of their skin is going to have a large effect on how makeup will look on the skin, despite the quality of the makeup itself. Many makeup artists say they would encourage people to spend on skincare, rather than higher end makeup items, if they had to choose. Having a great base will allow for smoother application, and will allow for even less expensive products to look flawless. If you do not have a good base, a foundation is still going to look bad on the skin regardless of the price.</p>

                <h3>Cleanser</h3>
                    <p>Cleansing ones skin daily is incredibly imporant, especially for those who wear makeup. Some people use cleansers that also remove their makeup, but others prefer to remove their makeup first, and then wash their face with another cleanser. Ones skin type and their main concerns will determine what face wash should be used. Those with dry skin should use more gentle and hydrating cleansers, while those trying to fight off acne should use cleansers such as ones containing salicylic acid, an ingredient used in many skincare products to fight acne.</p>

                <h3>Oil</h3>
                    <p>One skincare item that has grown in popularity in recent years is facial oils. There are an innumerous amount of facial oils one can find, and each try to achieve different things.</p>
                        <!-- <ul> -->
                            <p>Oils for Aging Skin: <br>Those with aging skin should consider using facial oils. Oils, which often contain antioxidants, prevent water loss within the skin, giving it a more plump look. These antioxidants also boost collagen within the skin. The best oils for aging skin include argan oil and rosehip seed oil.</p>
                            <p>Oils for Dry Skin: <br>Those with dry skin should definitely have facial oils within their skincare routine. For those combating this type of skin, it is recommended they use hydrating and moisturizing oils such as maracuja oil, argan oil, sunflower oil, and jojoba oil. </p>
                            <p>Oils for Acne Prone and Oily Skin: <br>A big issue with those with this skin type is that they automatically try to strip their skin of any oil and moisture. In fact, those with oily skin often have dehydrated skin, and moisturizing properly and using facial oils such as macadamia oil and tea tree oil can allow the skin to balance its oil production.</p>

                <h3>Moisturizer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Moisturizer is something that should be used by everyone, regardless of their skin type. As mentioned previously, many people with acne prone and oily skin refrain from any type of moisturizer as they think it will make their skin more oily. Continuously moisturizing ones skin, despite skin condition, will allow the skin to balance its oil levels. Moisturizer can of course add needed hydration to dry skin, and other moisturizers containing things like collagen and retinol can be great for maintaining a youthful look for aging skin.
